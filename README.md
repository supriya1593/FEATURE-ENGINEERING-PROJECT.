# FEATURE-ENGINEERING-PROJECT.Overview
This project focuses on feature engineering techniques to enhance the predictive performance of machine learning models. Feature engineering is the process of transforming raw data into meaningful features that can be used in machine learning algorithms to improve accuracy, interpretability, and overall model performance.

Objective
The main goal of this project is to demonstrate and apply various feature engineering techniques to improve the performance of machine learning models. The project will involve:

Cleaning and preprocessing raw data

Creating new features from existing ones (e.g., aggregations, transformations)

Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables

Feature selection and dimensionality reduction

Data Description
The dataset used in this project contains [brief description of dataset, e.g., "customer purchase behavior data," "housing prices data," etc.]. It includes the following columns:

Column 1: [Description of the column]

Column 2: [Description of the column]

Column 3: [Description of the column]

...

Feature Engineering Techniques Applied
Missing Data Imputation: Handling missing values using imputation strategies such as mean, median, mode, or more complex methods like KNN imputation.

Categorical Encoding: Applying techniques like one-hot encoding, label encoding, or target encoding to convert categorical variables into numerical formats.

Feature Scaling: Normalizing or standardizing numerical features to improve model performance.

Feature Creation: Generating new features from existing ones (e.g., date-related features, interaction terms).

Dimensionality Reduction: Techniques like PCA (Principal Component Analysis) or feature selection methods to reduce the feature space and improve model efficiency.

Feature Transformation: Applying mathematical transformations (e.g., logarithms, square roots) to make distributions more suitable for modeling.

Requirements
To run this project, you need to have Python and the following libraries installed:

pandas

numpy

scikit-learn

matplotlib

seaborn

Jupyter notebook

You can install the necessary packages using pip:

nginx
Copy
pip install -r requirements.txt
How to Use
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy
git clone https://github.com/your-username/Feature-Engineering-Project.git
cd Feature-Engineering-Project
Explore the notebooks:

notebooks/01-data-cleaning.ipynb: First, clean and preprocess the raw data.

notebooks/02-feature-selection.ipynb: Apply feature selection techniques.

notebooks/03-feature-transformation.ipynb: Explore feature transformations and visualizations.

Run the scripts: You can also run individual Python scripts under the src/ directory to apply feature engineering functions on the dataset.

bash
Copy
python src/preprocess.py
python src/feature_gen.py
Review the processed data: Once feature engineering is completed, you can find the processed dataset in the data/processed/ directory.
